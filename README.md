Linux - Ready,
Windows - Ready

# Darkelf (Custom PyQt5 Browser)

## Positives and Advantages

Customizability: Darkelf is highly customizable due to its PyQt5 framework, allowing developers to tailor features and user interface elements precisely to their needs.

Security Integration: It directly integrates cryptographic libraries like Crypto and offers options for AES and RSA encryption, enhancing data security and potentially enabling secure communications.

Granular Control: Users have granular control over JavaScript execution, anti-fingerprinting measures, Tor network integration, and HTTPS enforcement. This level of control can be beneficial for privacy enthusiasts or users needing specific security configurations.

Lightweight: Being a custom-built browser, it can be more lightweight compared to larger browsers like Firefox derivatives, potentially offering better performance on resource-constrained systems.

Educational and Development Benefits: Building a custom browser like Darkelf provides educational insights into browser internals, web security practices, and PyQt5 development, fostering learning opportunities.

## Encryption Support

AES-GCM Encryption: Darkelf securely manages an AES encryption key, ensuring sensitive data such as user credentials or stored information is encrypted, protecting it from unauthorized access.

RSA Encryption: It generates or loads RSA key pairs, enabling secure communication and potentially securing stored data through asymmetric encryption techniques.

## TOR and Quantum Encryption

Tor Network: Darkelf Browser includes the option to route traffic through the Tor network, providing enhanced anonymity and privacy by using a series of encrypted relays.

Quantum Encryption: While mentioned as a feature in the settings, the provided code does not detail the implementation of quantum encryption. Quantum encryption would provide theoretically unbreakable security by using principles of quantum mechanics to secure key exchanges. - This is a work in Progress

Both features aim to enhance user privacy and security, with Tor focusing on anonymity and quantum encryption aiming for unbreakable security.

## Benefits of Quantum Encryption

Unconditional Security: The security of quantum encryption is based on the laws of quantum mechanics, making it theoretically immune to any future advancements in computational power, including quantum computers.

Detection of Eavesdropping: Any attempt to intercept the quantum key alters its state, which can be detected by the communicating parties, ensuring the integrity of the key exchange.

## Anti-Fingerprinting

1. Canvas Fingerprinting Blocking: Disables canvas elements to prevent tracking via canvas fingerprinting.
2. WebRTC IP Leaks Protection: Protects against IP leaks through WebRTC by modifying the user agent.
3. Font Fingerprinting Protection: Disables running insecure content, helping to prevent font-based fingerprinting.
4. Blocking Device Sensors: Disables the use of certain sensors to reduce fingerprinting.
5. Limiting Browser Features: Disables full-screen support to limit fingerprinting opportunities.

JavaScript Control: Users can enable or disable JavaScript, providing control over scripts that run on web pages.

Persistent Settings: Uses QSettings for persistent storage of user preferences, including security and privacy settings, ensuring user preferences are maintained across sessions.

Proxy Configuration: Supports configuration for network proxies, allowing users to route their traffic through various proxy servers for added privacy.

## Theming and Customization

Theme Management: Users can switch between different themes (Dark Theme) to match their preferences, and CSS is injected to apply these themes.

## User Interface Features

Toolbar and Menu Bar: A toolbar and menu bar provide easy access to navigation controls (back, forward, reload, home) and security settings.

Homepage Setup: A customizable homepage with a search function that defaults to DuckDuckGo, a privacy-focused search engine. The homepage can also handle .onion sites for access through the Tor network.

## Network Security

Tor Network Integration: It supports routing traffic through the Tor network via SOCKS5 proxy settings. This feature enhances user anonymity by masking the user's IP address and encrypting traffic through multiple layers.

Mixed Content Blocking: Darkelf can block insecure content (HTTP) on HTTPS pages, reducing the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks and ensuring secure connections to websites.

## Customizable Themes and UI

While not a security feature directly, Darkelf allows users to choose between different themes (like dark, or custom colors based on modification in the code), potentially improving user experience and readability, which indirectly impacts security by enhancing usability.

## Event Handling and Filtering

The browser utilizes event filtering to intercept and modify navigation requests, such as enforcing HTTPS for HTTP requests. This feature helps protect against insecure connections and ensures data integrity during web browsing.

## Community and Development

Darkelf benefits from being an open-source project, potentially allowing community-driven improvements, security audits, and contributions, which can enhance its security over time.

Overall, Darkelf's emphasis on encryption, privacy controls, network security enhancements, and customization options makes it a strong choice for users looking to prioritize security and privacy in their browsing experience. As with any software, staying updated with security patches and best practices is essential to maintaining its security effectiveness.

## Additional Notes

Event Handling: Custom event filters and handlers allow for tailored interactions and additional security measures.

Persistent Settings Restoration: The browser restores settings on launch to ensure that security and privacy configurations are always active based on user preferences.

This combination of features makes Darkelf a privacy-focused web browser with several layers of security to protect users' data and enhance their online privacy.

JavaScript Management: Users have the ability to enable or disable JavaScript globally or on a per-tab basis. This control helps mitigate JavaScript-related attacks and enhances privacy by preventing scripts from executing without user consent.

Anti-Fingerprinting Measures: Darkelf implements measures to spoof or alter the browser's fingerprint, reducing the effectiveness of fingerprinting techniques used for tracking users across websites. Darkelf includes a script to spoof the user-agent string, which is a common fingerprinting metric. By changing the user-agent string to a generic value, Darkelf makes it more difficult for websites to uniquely identify the browser based on this information. The configure_web_engine_profile method sets various privacy-related attributes, which can help with anti-fingerprinting by limiting what information the browser exposes.

HTTPS Enforcement: The browser can enforce HTTPS connections for all websites, ensuring data transmitted between the browser and websites is encrypted and protected against interception or tampering. enforcing HTTPS ensures that the data exchanged between the browser and websites is encrypted, which prevents third parties from eavesdropping and potentially using fingerprinting techniques.
